# qhfz

A test for QCF font display and word-for-word manipulation
- used glyphs from quran.com api
- used woff2 font from quran.com next.js fonts folder

- works: can manipulate on word level (eg. highlight, change color, hide, etc)

TODO
- manipulate multiple words with a single swipe


Ultimate goal: Hifz app (PWA) that can work offline and cache fonts (similar to muhaffidh.app) with different ways of increasing hifz (eg. having an exam of fill in the blanks for difficult words, grading hifz level based on difficulty, having schedule for next hifz review tasks, ...)
